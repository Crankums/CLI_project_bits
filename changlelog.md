'0.1.1'
-App was crashing on 'run'. Cause seems to be 'pry' gem. Removed `require 'pry'` from `scraper.rb` and `environment.rb`. Not removed from `console`, so `bin/console` command should still work
-Changing git repository name from "CLI_project_bits" to 'velocity_rim_builder"
-changing relevant filenames from "cli_project" to "velocity_rim_builder"
